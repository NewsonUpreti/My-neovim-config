# My neovim configuration
## Whats neovim?
### Neovim is a CLI based code editor, the child of Vim built with lua programming language. Vi is the grandfather of neovim.
## How does it work?
### Neovim is blazing fast and works directly on terminal even in cloud based terminal to manage and fix server which makes it special if user have good command in it and doesn't support mouse and gui responses natively and not made for using with mouse. Simply, the mouse is useless in neovim.
## How to start using?
### Just download/clone my entire repository to get my configuration. After installing neovim in your computer, create `nvim` directory in your `.config` folder which is inside `/username/home/` directory.  now open `nvim` directory and copy all the files from this repository to the `nvim` folder. type `nvim` to launch neovim in terminal, press `esc` and type `:Tutor` to understand the basics.

## Thank you!
